# MinimalTwitter

A simplified version of Twitter. (client and server, CLI)

This program runs in the terminal and is not designed with a graphical interface.
Users can post tweets, follow each other, like tweets, and leave comments.

Please open each server and client file as Clion project (Right click, open as Clion project).

If you want to run the code through CMD please go to Add Configurations in CLion:
Client: set Executable to myCodesClient\cmake-build-debug\run.bat.
Server: set Executable to myCodesServer\cmake-build-debug\run.bat.

There are also two EXE files at (myCodesClient\cmake-build-debug and myCodesServer\cmake-build-debug) so you can test the project with them.
